Let's say your level looks like this: there are obviosuly areas that do not need to update, cause they are empty.
At the moment BendinGrass does not know it, so it will update the whole map
every time. Every update it has to check if every cell in the map is affected by a bender.
It's a lot of wasted calculations!

But we can do something about this. We can tell to split our volume in smaller ones, and do the calculations only on the characters inside each volume.
For example, we can divide our volume in 3x3 sub-volumes, and it will look like this:

I won't do the math on this, because it's very variable, but I would say that it's on average 80%+ more efficient.
