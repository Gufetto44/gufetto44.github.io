		<h2><center> About me </center></h2>
		Hi, my name is Cosimo, I am
25 years old, from Italy. I like science, gaming, music and of course
programming.
I'm currently an Unity C#
and Shader developer. I'm currently planning to release some packages
on the Unity Asset Store.
<BR>

More about my work:
<UL>
	<LI>Started to get
	interested in programming since I was in school, and started
	expermienting with Pascal, C, and then VB.Net.
	<LI>Around 2010 I started
	to work on some unofficial tools for the game Metin2, one of them
	was public too:
	<div class="box">
	<UL>
		<LI>Metin2 <A HREF="https://www.inforge.net/xi/threads/release-metin2remoteconsoletool-by-manhunter.77231/">Remote
		Console Tool</A> (Italian): It was a tool which provided a
		connection to your game server and allowed you to execute
		mysql/ftp/game commands (ie banning/kicking people, players recap,
		create/remove items, etc.) or execute custom commands or SQL queries.
		<LI>Metin2 Map Editor
		(Italian): I did this as I was experimenting with D3D9 libraries.
		It basically was my own (very basic) engine, based on dx9
		libraries. It was able to render the map data you passed to it, and
		edit its heightmaps, 3D objects, and monster spawns.
		<LI>A lot of minor ones.
	</UL>
	</div>
	<LI>When I stopped working
	on those tools, I wanted to create a simple game. I started another
	vb.net + dx9 project, but it was obviously a very complex thing to
	do, so I started to study/use C#, and learn Unity a little bit. I
	then dropped it because university.
	<LI>After a while (2014/15)
	I started  to work for a startup company: Crimson Games. We were a
	very small team, working on a big MMORPG project, <A HREF="https://connect.unity.com/u/5818d80732b306001b43af4b">Heroes
	of Asgard</A>, which then got stopped halfway in 2016. I was working
	on the client, including:
	<div class="box">
	<UL>
		
		<LI>Client side scripts
		<LI>Entities sync with the server : players, actions, skills, monsters, items, etc.
		<LI>Movements and inputs
		<LI>Animators for characters and monsters
		<LI>UI : menus, inventory, skills, buffs, minimap system, etc.
		<LI>Map creation : worked on 3 big maps. I designed them created the terrain and vegetation, and then filled with assets our modeller did.
		I also created a daytime and weather system for our maps, which was then sync'd with the server.
		<LI>Some shaders for multiple effects: rain/snow reacting materials for environment and characters, custom water shader<i>(not the one below)</i>, distortions, animated UI materials
		<LI>Basic visual effects : particle systems, other various VFX (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48WzRXK2boM">example</a>)
		
	</UL>
	</div>
	<LI>I worked on <a href="https://github.com/manhunterita/Habitat">Habitat</a>, for <a href="http://jams.gamejolt.io/indievaultgamejam">IndieVault gamejam 2016</a>. I did the controls/characters movements, and some graphics.
	<LI>I then started some
	other Unity projects as I was experimenting and learning new stuff,
	planning to release some of them on the asset store too: (in no
	particular order)<br>

		<LI><A HREF="https://forum.unity.com/threads/bendingrass-simple-interactable-grass.508211">BendinGrass</A>
		 - <i><a href="http://u3d.as/XEf">Asset Store</a></i>
		  - <i><a href="BigTerrain/BigTerrain.html">WebGL</a></i>
		<div class="box">I liked shaders, so I wanted to try Compute Shaders for grass
		touch bend. While I was learning about compute shaders, I noticed
		that it could have been a good package to release too. I later had to
		drop compute shaders for compatibility, and use vertex/fragment shaders
		instead. I worked on this a lot, it now provides its own rendering
		system, specialized in packing volumetric data on a texture 2D and
		supporting hundreds of objects thanks to the GPU computing.
		<br>
		<br>
		BendinGrass is currently my biggest asset published on the store.
		</div>
		
		<LI><a href="BubbleR/BubbleR.html">BubbleR</a>
		 - <i><a href="http://u3d.as/1wBx">Asset Store</a>
		<div class="box">Shader that I created for fun and to learn. It is an high quality, parametric bubble shader with a lot of customizable parameters, useful to achieve multiple different results with little effort, as you don't need to paint textures. Supports color noise, vertex animation, thin-film effect. It's also compatible with reflection probes and particles systems.</div>
		
		<LI><a href="https://youtu.be/8uvSRL502sk">HoloGrid</a>
		 - <i><a href="http://u3d.as/1Dz6">Asset Store</a>
		<div class="box">Another straightforward shader that I needed to render some grids and holograms. Decided to publish it on the Asset Store later on. Supports flickering, spatial noise, scan-line effect, view angle fading, triplanar mapping (very useful especially for grids, either world or local space).</div>
		
		<LI><A HREF="SnoopBoard/SnoopBoard.7z">SnoopBoard</a>
		<div class="box">
		This one is just a for-fun project that I created while experimenting with compute shaders. It is a very basic drawing software with the essential drawing functions (draw&amp;erase, undo&amp;redo, generate a Snoop
		Dogg, etc.).
		</div>
		
		<LI><A HREF="Caravan/Caravan_demo.html">Caravan Card Game</a>
		<div class="box">
		Yet another for-fun project, this time is a card game: Caravan!<br>
		Based on the popular card game inside Fallout:New Vegas (with some very minor rules changes). 
		</div>
		
		<LI><a href="https://youtu.be/XnvMAdjLxck">AudioSync</a><div class="box">A plugin
		useful for various effects based on audio signals, for example
		automatically animating your character as he/she speaks. It
		performs an FFT on the audioclip samples and provides frequency
		bands and other data, whit a customizable output function, which
		you can then use for whatever you want.</div>
		
		<LI><A HREF="https://youtu.be/gHITXo_nsoo">FloWater</A>
		<div class="box">Started it as a simple water shader while I was learning shader
		coding, with just refraction and 1 direction flow. After some time
		I decided to improve it, adding dynamic waterflow and more
		customizable colors. Eventually I will reflections and other stuff
		too.</div>
		
		<LI>Other minor things I
		was working on: 
		
		<UL>
			<LI>A triplanar shader
			pack, with some variants, like heightmap blending, bumpmap, splat
			maps, etc.
			<LI>A sign creator.
