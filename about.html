		<h2><center> About me </center></h2>
		Hi, my name is Cosimo, I am 26 years old, from Italy. I like science, gaming, music and of course programming.
		I'm currently working as an Unity Generalist, C# and Shader developer. I'm also an Unity Asset Store publisher.
<BR>

More about my work:
<UL>
	<LI>Started to get
	interested in programming since I was in school, and started
	expermienting with Pascal, C, and later VB.Net.
	<LI>Around 2010 I started
	to work on some unofficial tools for the game Metin2, one of them
	was public too:
	<div class="box">
	<UL>
		<LI>Metin2 <A HREF="https://www.inforge.net/xi/threads/release-metin2remoteconsoletool-by-manhunter.77231/">Remote
		Console Tool</A> (Italian): It was a tool which provided a
		connection to your game server and allowed you to execute
		mysql/ftp/game commands (ie banning/kicking people, players recap,
		create/remove items, etc.) or execute custom commands or SQL queries.
		<LI>Metin2 Map Editor
		(Italian): I did this as I was experimenting with D3D9 libraries.
		It basically was my own (very basic) engine, based on dx9
		libraries. It was able to render the map data you passed to it, and
		edit its heightmaps, 3D objects, and monster spawns.
		<LI>A lot of minor ones.
	</UL>
	</div>
	<LI>When I stopped working
	on those tools, I wanted to create a simple game. I started another
	VB.Net + DX9 project, but it was obviously a very complex thing to
	do, so I started to study/use C#, and learn Unity a little bit.
	<LI>After a while (2014/15)
	I started  to work for a startup company: Crimson Games. We were a
	very small team, working on a big MMORPG project, <A HREF="https://connect.unity.com/u/5818d80732b306001b43af4b">Heroes
	of Asgard</A>, which then got stopped halfway in 2016. I was working
	on the client, including:
	<div class="box">
	<UL>
		
		<LI>Client side scripts
		<LI>Entities sync with the server : players, actions, skills, monsters, items, etc.
		<LI>Movements and inputs
		<LI>Animators for characters and monsters
		<LI>UI : menus, inventory, skills, buffs, minimap system, etc.
		<LI>Map creation : worked on 3 big maps. I designed them, created the terrain and vegetation, and then filled with assets our artist did.
		I also created a daytime and weather system for our maps, which was then sync'd with the server.
		<LI>Some shaders for multiple effects: rain/snow reacting materials for environment and characters, custom water shader<i>(not the one below)</i>, distortions, animated UI materials
		<LI>Basic visual effects : particle systems, other various VFX (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48WzRXK2boM" target="_blank">example</a>)
		
	</UL>
	</div>
	<LI>I worked on <a href="https://github.com/manhunterita/Habitat" target="_blank">Habitat</a>, for <a href="http://jams.gamejolt.io/indievaultgamejam" target="_blank">IndieVault gamejam 2016</a>. I did the controls/characters movements, and some graphics.
	
	<LI>Starting from late 2016 I also started some other Unity projects as I was experimenting and learning new stuff,
	planning to release some of them on the Asset Store too:<br>
	<UL>
		<LI><A HREF="https://forum.unity.com/threads/bendingrass-simple-interactable-grass.508211" target="_blank">BendinGrass</A>
		 - <i><a href="http://u3d.as/XEf" target="_blank">Asset Store</a></i>
		 - <i><a href="BigTerrain/BigTerrain.html" target="_blank">WebGL</a></i>
		<div class="box">I liked shaders, so I wanted to try Compute Shaders for grass
		touch bend. While I was developing it, I noticed
		that it could have been a good package to release too. I later had to
		drop compute shaders for compatibility issues, and use regular vertex/fragment shaders
		instead. I worked on this <b>a lot</b>, it now provides its own rendering
		system, specialized in packing volumetric data on a texture 2D and
		supporting hundreds of grass-bending objects thanks to the GPU computing.
		It also offers an handful of other features, such as space partitioning, dynamic
		volumes, terrain heightmap based optimizations
		<br>
		<br>
		BendinGrass is currently my biggest asset published on the store.
		</div>
		
		<LI><a href="BubbleR/BubbleR.html" target="_blank">BubbleR</a>
		 - <a href="http://u3d.as/1wBx" target="_blank">Asset Store</a>
		<div class="box">Shader that I created for fun and to learn. It is an high quality, parametric bubble shader with a lot of customizable parameters, useful to achieve multiple different results with little effort, as you don't need to paint textures. Supports color noise, vertex animation, thin-film effect. It's also compatible with reflection probes and particles systems.</div>
		
		<LI><a href="https://youtu.be/8uvSRL502sk" target="_blank">HoloGrid</a>
		 - <a href="http://u3d.as/1Dz6" target="_blank">Asset Store</a>
		<div class="box">Another straightforward shader that I needed to render some grids and holograms. Decided to publish it on the Asset Store later on. Supports flickering, spatial noise, scan-line effect, view angle fading, triplanar mapping (very useful especially for grids, either world or local space).</div>
		
		<LI><A HREF="SnoopBoard/SnoopBoard.7z" target="_blank">SnoopBoard</a>
		<div class="box">
		This one is just a for-fun project that I created while experimenting with compute shaders. It is a very basic drawing software with the essential drawing functions (draw&amp;erase, undo&amp;redo, generate a Snoop
		Dogg, etc.).
		</div>
		
		<LI><A HREF="Caravan/Caravan_demo.html" target="_blank">Caravan Card Game</a>
		<div class="box">
		Yet another for-fun project, this time is a card game: Caravan!<br>
		Based on the popular card game inside Fallout:New Vegas (with some very minor rules changes). 
		</div>
		
		<LI><a href="https://youtu.be/XnvMAdjLxck" target="_blank">AudioSync</a><div class="box">A plugin
		useful for various effects based on audio signals, for example
		automatically animating your character as he/she speaks. It
		performs an FFT on the audioclip samples and provides frequency
		bands and other data, whit a customizable output function, which
		you can then use for whatever you want.</div>
		
		<LI><A HREF="https://youtu.be/gHITXo_nsoo" target="_blank">FloWater</A>
		<div class="box">Simple water shader, with just refraction and 1 direction flow. After some time
		I decided to improve it, adding dynamic waterflow and more
		customizable colors. Eventually I will add reflections and other stuff
		too.</div>
		
		<LI>Other minor asset store projects I was working on (not mature/documented enough yet): 
		<div class="box">
		<UL>
			<LI>A triplanar shader
			pack, with some variants, like heightmap blending, bumpmap, splat
			maps, etc.
			<LI>A sign creator.
			<LI>Highlight and indicator shaders.
		</UL>
		</div>
	</UL>
	
	<LI>2019-2020 I worked on <i>Duke it Out in the Arena</i> as a programmer.
		<div class="box">
			Duke it Out in The Arena is a multiplayer party game, in which the players have to achieve different goals, by using objects in the arenas to interact with other players. Goals may differ depending on the selected game mode. I'm part of the team as an Unity/C# programmer. I work on client, server, gameplay, and implementation of the various assets.

		<LI>Early 2020-2021 working on Summertime Madness - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1360550/Summertime_Madness/">Steam page</a>
			<div class="box">
				<p>
					Summertime Madness is a puzzle game <i>(soon to be released on Consoles)</i> that I worked on, as part of DP Games.
					I did all of the scripting, most of the shaders, Unity general stuff and some Playmaker state machines.
					A lot of cool stuff went into this game, in order to achieve decent illusions.
					<br>
					Two of my favourites are probably the <b>Escher room</b> illusion and the <b>Endless twisted corridor</b>

			<LI>2021 - Rat Simulator</a>
				<div class="box">
					<p>
						Side-project started with DP Games. Currently very early stage of developing.
						<br>
						At DP Games, we are very passionate about rats rights. We want to raise awareness about the struggle of being a rodent in the modern world. <br>
						You have to feel the struggle of being a <b>pest</b>, and not a pet, of being victim of <b>ratism</b>, of living in the poorest part of the <b>neighborwoods</b>.
						<br><br>
						You play as a rat, in order to complete your mission: survive another day...
						The end goal here, is to achieve a pleasant art style, combined with satisfying controls, while giving the player the full rat experience!
